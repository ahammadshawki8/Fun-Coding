# Code for Fun, Program for Fun :D
We always find different types of equation or function in our textbooks or internet. But sometimes, we don't understand where, when and how to apply them.
But we can code those functions to initialize them. So, let's code and feel those functions!
GET....SET....CODE!!!!!!!

BTW, it is one of my past time work. So, It is not necessary to learn the materials of this repository. However, you can see the codes once to get an understanding about how different functions can be implemented.
